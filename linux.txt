linux

boot process
on button -> 

first - bios/uefi starts up --> bios is older and uefi( Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ) is modern

second - POST - power on self test to see all devices are working properly or not

third - boot loader software is loaded (stored in the first chunk of the hard drive called MBR), GRUB is a widely used bootloader for Linux systems and some other Unix-like operating systems.
It allows users to choose between different operating systems or kernel configurations to boot into when starting their computer
eg : 
		# Set default boot entry
		set default=0
		
		# Timeout in seconds before default boot entry is automatically selected
		set timeout=10
		
		# Define different boot entries
		menuentry "Ubuntu Linux" {
			set root=(hd0,1)
			linux /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-88-generic root=/dev/sda1
			initrd /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-88-generic
		}
		
		menuentry "Windows 10" {
			set root=(hd0,2)
			chainloader +1
		}

four - kernel is loaded into the memory It decompresses itself and starts executing , It initializes essential hardware components and device drivers
needed to interact with hardware like CPU, memory, disks, etc , It sets up interrupt handlers, initializes scheduler, and starts the idle task.

five - Once the kernel initialization is complete, the kernel starts the init process (init or systemd in modern Linux distributions).
The init process is the first userspace process with PID 1 and is responsible for initializing the system services and other essential processes.
It mounts the root filesystem (specified by the kernel parameters) as read-only initially.

six - it starts all the /etc/innittab or systemd unit files and starts essentials deamons
It mounts other filesystems specified in /etc/fstab and sets up the environment for user login.

seven - if systemd is configured to have a gui - loads up

linux file system
bin refers to binary files which are executables , programs and application  eg ls,cat etc
sbin - system binaries which are used by system administrator (usually used in single user mode where we login into the system as single user that is as root
and make changes and important configurations like repairs or upgr)
