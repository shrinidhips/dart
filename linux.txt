linux

boot process
on button -> 

first - bios/uefi starts up --> bios is older and uefi( Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ) is modern

second - POST - power on self test to see all devices are working properly or not

third - boot loader software is loaded (stored in the first chunk of the hard drive called MBR), GRUB is a widely used bootloader for Linux systems and some other Unix-like operating systems.
It allows users to choose between different operating systems or kernel configurations to boot into when starting their computer
eg : 
		# Set default boot entry
		set default=0
		
		# Timeout in seconds before default boot entry is automatically selected
		set timeout=10
		
		# Define different boot entries
		menuentry "Ubuntu Linux" {
			set root=(hd0,1)
			linux /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-88-generic root=/dev/sda1
			initrd /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-88-generic
		}
		
		menuentry "Windows 10" {
			set root=(hd0,2)
			chainloader +1
		}

four - kernel is loaded into the memory It decompresses itself and starts executing , It initializes essential hardware components and device drivers
needed to interact with hardware like CPU, memory, disks, etc , It sets up interrupt handlers, initializes scheduler, and starts the idle task.

five - Once the kernel initialization is complete, the kernel starts the init process (init or systemd in modern Linux distributions).
The init process is the first userspace process with PID 1 and is responsible for initializing the system services and other essential processes.
It mounts the root filesystem (specified by the kernel parameters) as read-only initially.

six - it starts all the /etc/innittab or systemd unit files and starts essentials deamons
It mounts other filesystems specified in /etc/fstab and sets up the environment for user login.

seven - if systemd is configured to have a gui - loads up


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

linux file system
bin refers to binary files which are executables , programs and application  eg ls,cat etc
sbin - system binaries which are used by system administrator (usually used in single user mode where we login into the system as single user that is as root
and make changes and important configurations like repairs or upgr)




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basic commands

head - usage "head -n 10 filename" - to get first n number of line in the file
tail - usage "tail -n 10 filename" - to get last n number of line in the file
sort - usage "sort filename" - sorts a file as per alphabetical order , "sort -n filname" to sort numerically
cat - usage "cat file1 file2" - Concatenates files and prints on the standard output.

Chapter 1

The kernel
one of the man job is sub divide the memory and make sure all the process get the memory share

the kernel manages tasks in four general system areas
Process Management  : which process must use cpu
Memory Management: keeping track of memory , which is the currently allocated to a given process which my be shared or which might be free
Devices Management: kernel is the interface between hardware and processes
System calls and support : Process make system calls to talk to the kernel 

Process Management
* Describe start , pause , resume , schedule and terminate
* main idea is how cpu is utilized by the process
* Consider a CPU with one core , many process use the same cpu but in practice at a time only one process can use the cpu at a given fraction of time
* the act of processes giving the control of cpu to another process is called as a context-switch
* each piece of time is called as time slice which gives each process enough time for significant computation
* since this time slice is very small humans cant perceive them hence computers has capability to multitasking
* Eg

1.The CPU interrupts the current process based on internal timer and gives control to kernel for kernel mode
2.The kernel records the current state of the CPU and memory which will be essential to resume the process that was interrupted
3.The kernel performs the task that has come up in the preceding time-slice eg I/O, device call etc
4.The kernel is now to ready tot let another process run , it analyzes the list of processes that are ready to run and chooses one
5.Kernel prepares the memory for this new process and the prepare cpu
6.The kernel tells the cpu how long the time-slice for this process will last
7.The kernel switches the CPU into user mode and hands the control of the cpu to process

This kernel runs between the process time-slices during the context switch

Memory Management
The kernel must manage memory during context-switch which could be a complex job 
these are the conditions
* The kernel should have its own private area that user process can't use
* Each user process needs its own section  of memory
* One user process shouldn't be able to acces the private memory of another
* User process can share memory
* Some memory could be read-only

modern system has MMU(memory management unit) that enables memory access schema called as Virtual Memory
* when using VirtualMem the process doesnot directly access the memory by its physical location in the hardware
* Insted it make the process to consider it has the entire process to itself
* When the process wants access to some memory the mmu intecepts the access and uses memory address map to translate the memory address from process point of view to into actual physical memoryaddress in the machine
* the kernel will initialize and alter and maintain this memory address map
* Eg: During a contesxt switch the kernel has to switch the address map of the coming process
This implementation of the address map is called as a page table

Device Driver Management
* Kernels job wrt device management is comparatively simple/
* Devices should be directly accessed only by the kernel , specifically in kernel mode\
* Difffernt devices may have different interfaces sometimes even if they do the same job
* hence the device drivers have traditionally been part kernel and hence have a unified interface to user process and simplify the software developers job

System Calls and Support
* There are several features of kernel that are available for user process
* To be specific these can be called as syscalls which user process cannnot do it right or not
	eg : opening reading writing a file can involve system calls

There are 2 systemcalls called as fork() and exec():
fork() : when are process and calls fork()  the kernel creates a near identical copy of process.
exec() : when a process calls exec(program) , the kernel loads and start the program, replacing the current process.

* Other than the init process all user process in the linux system starts as a result of fork()
* Most of the time we run exec() to start a new program instead of creating a copy of existing process
* eg is when you run ls command in the terminal window the shell that is running calls fork to create a copy of shell and the new shell runs exec(ls) to run ls.
diagram	
shell --> fork() --> shell
                       copy of shell --> exec(ls) --> ls


User space
the main memory that the kernel allocates for the user process is called as user space
because the process is simply a state in the memory
user space is the memory for entire collection of running process

process types and interactions

			user interface   <-------> web browser
			     /   \    \		    /	     \
			    /     \    	 \	   /	      \
			   /       \	    \ 	  /	       \
			  /         \	        \/	    name caching server
			 /           \	      	/  \	   /    	|
			/             \        /      \/		|
		       /               \      /    /      \		|
	network configuration    communication bus      Diagonostic logging


Users:
User is an entity in linux that can run processes and own files
User is mostly associated by username however the kernel identifies a user by numeric identifier called as userid.
Users primarily exist to support permissions and boundries.
Every user-space has a user owner and proccess is said to run as owner
A user may terminate or modify its process but cannot interfere with other users process
In addition, users may own files and choose whether to share them with other users.


User processes make up the environment that you directly interact with;
the kernel manages processes and hardware. Both the kernel and processes reside in memory.

Chapter 2
Basic commands and Directory Hierarchy

Shell -Bournne shell (/bin/sh) developed by Bell Labs
linux user enhanced version of bourneshell called as bourne-again shell also called as bash
bash is the default shell in linux

cat file1 file2

Standard input output
Unix processes use I/O streams to read and write data. Processes read data from input streams and write data into output streams
Streams are very flexible , eg: source for input stream can be a file , a terminal window or even output of another process

$cat
(this will take input from standard input stream and run until we press CRRL-D)
Pressing CTRL-D on an empty line stops the current standard input entry from the terminal with an EOF (end-of-file) message (and often terminates a program).
Don’t confuse this with CTRL-C, which usually terminates a program regardless of its input or output.

basic commands
ls , cp  , mv , touch , rm , echo , cd , mkdir , rmdir

* matches all eg echo * - gives all file/dir names in curdir
? matches one char - eg: b?at matched boat and brat

if we don't want the shell to expand the glob for us we can use '*' quotes so that it ignores

intermediate commands
grep - this will give the matched output for a given expression

$ grep root /etc/passwd
$ grep root /etc/*
 grep command options - most importantly -i (case insensitive) -v(matched inverse which means doesn't match the given expression)
grep understands regular expression also (RE is more than just a simple wildcard)
1) .* matches zero or more chars
2) .+ matched one or more chars
3) . matches exactly one char

less command is userfull to print less content of a file

pwd is used to print the current working direcxtory

diff is used to find the difference between the two text files
eg : [shrinidhi@osboxes examples]$ diff data.txt help.txt
5c5
< 40 go 40000 India
---
> 40 go 40000 Bangalore

file is a command that gives what type of file is a given file
[shrinidhi@osboxes examples]$ file data.csv
data.csv: ASCII text

find is used find a file in a give directory
eg :
[root@osboxes ~]# find / -name data.*
/home/shrinidhi/examples/data.txt
/home/shrinidhi/examples/data.csv
/usr/lib/firmware/RTL8192E/data.img
/usr/lib/firmware/ath6k/AR6002/data.patch.hw2_0.bin
/usr/lib/firmware/ath6k/AR6003/hw1.0/data.patch.bin
/usr/lib/firmware/ath6k/AR6003/hw2.0/data.patch.bin
/usr/lib/firmware/ath6k/AR6003/hw2.1.1/data.patch.bin
/usr/lib/firmware/ath6k/AR6003.1/hw2.1.1/data.patch.bin

[root@osboxes ~]# find /home/shrinidhi -name data.*
/home/shrinidhi/examples/data.txt
/home/shrinidhi/examples/data.csv

[shrinidhi@osboxes ~]$ find -name data.csv
./examples/data.csv

head and tail
head and tails is used to get first 10 and last 10 lines of a given file
to change the number of lines use -n option 

sort 
it is used to sort lines in a file as per alphanumeric characters
[shrinidhi@osboxes examples]$ cat sorttest.txt
20 abdevil 20000 Belgium
ID Name Salary Country
10 pole 10000 India
40 go 40000 India
[shrinidhi@osboxes examples]$ sort sorttest.txt
10 pole 10000 India
20 abdevil 20000 Belgium
40 go 40000 India
ID Name Salary Country

changing password and shell
passwd is used to change password
chsh is used to change shell

Environment variable and shell variables
Shell can hold temporary variable called as shell variables, containing value of text strings
[shrinidhi@osboxes notes]$ STUFF=blah
[shrinidhi@osboxes notes]$ echo $STUFF
blah

An Environment variable is similar to shell variable but is not specific to a shell.
If a program in a shell needs that variable the program can use that environment variable
child processes inherit environment variables from their parent, many programs read them for configuration and options
eg:
[shrinidhi@osboxes examples]$ export STUFF
[shrinidhi@osboxes examples]$ sh myscript.sh
blah

The Command PATH
PATH is a special environment variable that contains the command path (or path for short)
Its basically a list of directories that the shell searches to locate a command.
If programs with the same name appear in several directories in the path, the shell runs the first matching program.
eg:
[shrinidhi@osboxes ~]$ echo $PATH
/home/shrinidhi/.local/bin:/home/shrinidhi/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin

To tell the shell to look in more places for programs, change the PATH environment variable
$ PATH=$PATH:dir

Shell Input and Output
$command > file
$command >> file 
This will redirect the output file only if the output is success
in case of failure it print the error in the terminal this is called as standard error
to put standard errro to a file
eg:
[shrinidhi@osboxes ~]$ ls /fffffffff > f
ls: cannot access '/fffffffff': No such file or directory
[shrinidhi@osboxes ~]$ ls /fffffffff > f 2>e
[shrinidhi@osboxes ~]$
[shrinidhi@osboxes ~]$ cat e
ls: cannot access '/fffffffff': No such file or directory

which means if success put it into f and on failure put it to e
The number 2 specifies the stream ID that the shell modifies. Stream ID 1 is standard output (the default), and 2 is standard error.
You can also send the standard error to the same place as stdout with the >& notation
eg 
$ ls /fffffffff > f 2>&1

shell input redirection (<)
[shrinidhi@osboxes ~]$ tail < /proc/cpuinfo
cpuid level     : 22

power management:

Listing and Management of processes
For quick listing of process we can run ps command
ps -f - in detail
pa -e - extended
PID - process ID

ps x Show all of your running processes.
ps ax Show all processes on the system, not just the ones you own.
ps u Include more detailed information on processes.

Process termination
to send a terminate signal for a process you send kill command
eg kill PID
where by default kill give TERM signal which is terminate , you can choose to give other options like STOP, CONT etc
eg kill -STOP pid - to freeze a process instead of terminating it
eg kill -CONT pid - A stopped process is still in memory, ready to pick up where it left off

When a process is running in the terminal using CTRL-C is giving and interrupt to the process and killing it using the INT signal
kill -l gives different mapping of signal numbers to name
eg kill -2 3018 (2 is interrupt signal)

Job control
shell supports job control its a way to send TSTP(similar to STOP) and CONT signal
this helps to suspend and switch between programs
TSTP can be sent using CTRL-Z and process starts again by using fg message

nohup command can be used to run a program in the background

File modes and Permissions
eg:
[shrinidhi@osboxes ~]$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-rw-r--. 1 shrinidhi shrinidhi 58 Oct  5 13:36 e
-rw-rw-r-- - first - is type , next rw- is user , next is group and next is other permissions
Some executable files have an s in the user permissions listing instead of an x. This indicates that the executable is setuid, meaning that when you execute the program, it runs as though the file owner is the user instead of you.

modify permission can be done using chmod command
Directories also have permissions. You can list the contents of a directory if it’s readable, but you can only access a file in a directory if the directory is executable

Symbolic links
A symbolic link is a file that points to another file or directory , effectively creating aliases , basically they offer faster access to obscure directory paths
$ ln -s target linkname is used to create symbolic links
where target is where we want to point and linkname is name of symbolic link
-s represents symbolic

Archiving and Compressing files
compress
gzip - user gunzip filename.gz to uncompress and gzip file to compress

Archive
tar -cvf and tar -xvf
f- file
v- verbose
c- create
x- extract

both -Compressed Archives
$ gunzip file.tar.gz
$ tar xvf file.tar

Linux Directory Hierarchy Essentials
/ -
  - bin 
  - dev
  - etc
  - usr - bin , man , lib , local , sbin , share 
  - home
  - lib
  - sbin
  - tmp
  - var - log , tmp

/bin - Contains ready-to-run programs including most of them like cp,ls . They are binary files written in C.
/dev - Contains device files
/etc - this is the core config directory like boot, device, network.
/home - holds directories for regular users
/lib - An abbreviation for library, this directory holds library files containing code that executables can use
/proc - directory contains information about currently running processes as well as some kernel parameters
/sbin - The place for system executables. Programs in /sbin directories relate to system management, so regular users usually do not have /sbin components in their command paths.
/tmp - A storage area for smaller, temporary files that you don’t care much about.
/usr - 
/boot - this has boot configurations
/media - this has base attachment point for removable media such as flash drives.
/opt - This has 3rd party services 

usr has 
/includes - holds files c complier
/local - is where administrators can install their own software
/man - contains manual pages

Kernel Location
On Linux systems, the kernel is normally a binary file /vmlinuz or /boot/vmlinuz

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 3 

The udev system enables user-space programs to automatically configure and use new devices
where udev is a device manager for the Linux kernel

the kernel presents many of the device I/O interfaces to user processes as files. These device files are sometimes called device nodes
devices are usually represented in the /dev directory

$ echo blah blah > /dev/null
Like any other command with redirected output, this sends some stuff
from the standard output to a file. However, the file is /dev/null, a device, so
the kernel bypasses its usual file operations and uses a device driver on data
written to this device

$ ls -l
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 1 Sep 6 08:37 sda1
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Sep 6 08:37 null
prw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Mar 3 19:17 fdata
srw-rw-rw- 1 root root 0 Dec 18 07:43 log

note the first character represents the kind of device 
eg : b , c , p , s - refers to block, socket , pipe and socket

Block Device: Process will access data from a block device in fixed chunks , disks can be easily split into block of data.
Character Device : Character device work with data streams , we can only read char from and write char to a character device eg : /dev/null
			these devices don't have a fixed size , when we read from or write into the kernel performs read or write operation for it
			Printers directly attached to your computer are represented by character devices.
Pipe device : Named pipes are like character devices, with another process at the other end of the I/O stream instead of a kernel driver.
Socket device : Sockets are special-purpose interfaces that are frequently used for interprocess communication.
